# PersonaParley

PersonaParley is a web-based platform for simulating debates between AI personas with diverse viewpoints. The app lets users create or select debate personas—such as "Southern Conservative" or "Progressive Economist"—and orchestrate dynamic debates by choosing who speaks next and directing responses.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Personas:** Create or select pre-defined personas with unique characteristics.
- **Dynamic Control:** Choose which persona speaks next and control the flow of debate.
- **Adaptive Response Styles:** Adjust AI response styles (e.g., formal, aggressive, academic) to suit the debate context.
- **Inspiration & Guidance:** Access suggested personas and debate topics to spark your discussion.

## Technical Overview
- **Frontend:** Built with React, providing a modern, interactive user interface.
- **Backend:** Powered by FastAPI, offering a lightweight, high-performance API.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on AWS Amplify for a scalable, cost-efficient solution.
- **AI Integration:** Leverages APIs from OpenAI, DeepSeek, and Anthropic to generate debate responses.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Utilizes AWS Lambda and API Gateway to minimize costs when the app is idle.
